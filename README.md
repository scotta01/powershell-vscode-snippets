# My Powershell snippets for Visual Studio Code

Initial commit only has a snippet imported from ISE. I will gradually add more as required.

* Copy powershell.json to your snippets path for Visual Studio Code. For example
    ```
    C:\Users\scotta01\AppData\Roaming\Code\User\snippets
    ```
#### Add to existing snippets

* Alternatively, open Visual Studio Code, press Ctrl,Shift + P to open the command palette
* Type snippets and select "Preferences: Open User Snippets"
* Type Powershell
* Copy the snippets into your existing snippets
